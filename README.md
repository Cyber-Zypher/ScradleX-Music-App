## Installation
[<img src="https://github.com/machiav3lli/oandbackupx/blob/034b226cea5c1b30eb4f6a6f313e4dadcbb0ece4/badge_github.png" alt="Get it on GitHub" height="80">](https://github.com/vfsfitvnm/ViMusic/releases/latest)

After installing, I recommend executing the following ADB command to neutralize some animation lags you may experience in cold starts:
```
adb shell cmd package compile -r bg-dexopt it.vfsfitvnm.vimusic
```

## Known problems
The application is using `androidx.media3`, which is unstable. Expect random crashes or buggy notification behaviours. Hopefully, they will be fixed within the next alpha release.

There's a huge room for improvements! Please open an issue to report bugs, discuss ideas and so on.
